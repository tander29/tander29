### Oh Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Travis

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Gatsby and Node/Express
- ðŸŒ± I have dabbled with Javascript/React, Python/Django, Typescript, and Go lang
- ðŸ˜„ My Current Job involves React and Scala!


![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=tander29&layout=compact&theme=vue-dark)

![Github Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=tander29&show_icons=true&theme=merko)

 My current job's repos are private and don't seem to add to the stats, so just imagine there is more javascript, scala, scss, and a dash of python/sql

Leave the original why not!  But i do disagree, I think all my repo's are special
**tander29/tander29** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
